excerpt: "A family of dense retrieval models (33M–7.6B) for improved textual retrieval in data-scarce disaster management domains."
---

I developed **DMRetriever**, a family of six dense retrieval models initialized from both encoder-only (BERT) and decoder-only (Qwen) backbones, targeting **data-scarce domains** (e.g., disaster management).

Highlights:
- Models spanning **33M to 7.6B** parameters
- Optimized for **domain-specific retrieval** and low-resource settings
- Submitted to ARR (Oct 2025); intended for ACL 2026
