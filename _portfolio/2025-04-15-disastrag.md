**DisastRAG** augments general-domain LLMs using **agentic RAG** for disaster management QA.

Current components:
- Memory management agent (core / short-term / long-term memory) for multi-turn conversations
- Multi-channel retrieval + re-ranking (dense, keyword, text-to-SQL, web search, fusion)
- Knowledge base construction for structured + unstructured sources with hybrid chunking
